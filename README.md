## How to use
all source code in this repo is intended to be compiled through ubuild which resolves multi-level imports ahead of time

a ubuild bootstrap script can be found here: [ubuild_bs.src](https://gist.github.com/Jan200101/224bb2a87ed691b33891dc393330b630)

imports are done relatively so only the folder structure needs to be kept

## How to use
all source code in this repo is intended to be compiled through ubuild which resolves multi-level imports ahead of time

a ubuild bootstrap script can be found here: [ubuild_bs.src](https://gist.github.com/Jan200101/224bb2a87ed691b33891dc393330b630)

Since imports need to be absolute they are prepared for my setup.
To adapt to your system copy this repo structure somewhere onto your system and replace all instances of `/home/Snetrz/source/` with a path to it.
